## Deployment
Our site is deployed via Google Cloud Platform here: https://university-idb.uc.r.appspot.com/

## Running locally 
You will probably want to use a virtual environment for the pip install. We're using python 3. 

Run the following in your shell to start the server at `localhost:5000/`

```cd idb_app
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
